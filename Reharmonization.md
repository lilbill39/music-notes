# Reharmonization

Reharmonization lets you recontextualize a melody to give different feelings

## Level 1 - Simple diatonic substitution

You can substitue chords with similar function (tonic - I, iii, vi, predominant - ii, IV, dominant - V, viiÂ°).

Substitutions can allow you to achieve different voice leading, directions, etc. Combining that with inversion choices and varying chord extensions expands the possibilities.

## Level 2 - Adding chromaticism

Pick a few chords from original as targets. Then set those up with something that will resolve to the targeted chords. This can also let you build walk-ups, resolutions, secondary dominants, leading tone dimished, etc.

The pre-resolution chords are tense so they're a good opportunity for extensions.

## Level 3 - Relative minor

Treat the melody as if it's in a different key. This can be hard with very dissimilar keys, so start with relative minor.

As a first idea, take the Roman numeral analysis and map that to the new key (relative minor). Need to consider how the resolutions feel in light of the melody. Having a melody that's strongly in the original key can make the resolutions feel less valid. A workaround in such a case is to use extensions resolve in the new key but incorporate the melody.

## Level 4 - Close key

Choose a key that's fairly close (mostly same notes). Options are the key of the 4 or 5 or their relative minors the 2 or the 3.

## Level 5 - Distant key

Reharmonizing in a distant key requires a larger harmonic vocabulary and some puzzle solving. The distant key means that the melody will frequently be chromatic to the key.

Take account of all of the melody notes to see which ones are in and out of the key. That will then guide how you choose various chords to incorporate and not clash with them.

## Level 6 - Bar-by-bar

The goal here is to avoid a typical functional feel and see what interesting harmonic colors you can bring out with the harmony. Isolate each bar and see what chords could fit with that melody with little to no consideration for other bars.

To make dissonant harmonic movements more palatable, try to look for held notes between the chords that fit well with the melody.

## Level 7 - Voice leading

Instead of thinking chord to chord, consider each note in the chord as its own melodic line. Build the harmony trying to make strong lines leading to good harmony keeping the larger context in mind.

Because voice leading is complex, it's good to pick a few target points to aim for as guide posts. Can set up one voice (e.g. bassline) and then see what chords work.

## General notes

* Major 7th on 4 chord sounds good, especially when the 9th is in the melody
* Consider a walk-down like IV-iv-I
* "When in doubt use a dominant chord. They can take on nearly any extension and work reasonably well.". For example, a V7#5 (augmented dominant)
