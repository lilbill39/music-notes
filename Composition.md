# Composition

## Open music theory

### Cantus firmi

http://openmusictheory.com/cantusFirmus.html

Lots of "rules" there. Strive for:

* Smoothness, independency & integrity, variety, motion toward a goal

### First-species counterpoint

http://openmusictheory.com/firstSpecies.html

* Begin and end on perfect intervals. When below use P1 / P8 only as P5 is confusing to which is tonic
* Approach tonic with contrary stepwise motion
* Single climax in counterpoint that doesn't coincide with main line
* Avoid voice crossing and overlap (hitting previous note of other voice)
* Stay within a perfect 12th
* Unisons only for first and last notes (they're very stable)
* Don't use the same perfect consonance: P5-P5 or P8-P8 (including different pitch classes)
    * Too stable and promotes tonal fusion rather than independent lines
* Vary motion type (parallel, similar, contrary, oblique) with a preference to contrary
* Don't repeat same consonance more than 3 times in a row
* Don't move into perfect consonance by similar motion (called direct/hidden octaves)
* Strategy
    * Start from end for unison
    * Penultimate is contrary and can't cross
    * Then go to beginning
    * Pick a climax that doesn't line up with cantus

#### Exercises

Minor key counterpoint above

* Too much parallel motion (3rds)
* No climax in counterpoint

Major key counterpoint below

Cantus:       c  d  e  f  g  d  f  e  d  c
Counterpoint: c  b  a  c  d  b  a  g  b  c
Intervals:    1  m3 5  4  4  m3 m6 6 m3 1

Problems:

* Climax coincides w/ cantus

Fixed:

Cantus:       c  d  e  f  g  d  f  e  d  c
Counterpoint: c1 B  A  d  c  B  A  G  B  c
Intervals:    1  m3 5  m3 5  m3 m6 6 m3  1

## Second species counterpoint

http://openmusictheory.com/secondSpecies.html

* Counterpoint moves in half notes against cantus firmus in whole notes
* Introduces new fundamental musical problems
    * Strong and weak beats
    * Passing tone dissonance
* Dissonance allows for tension. Must balance with consonance to promote fusion.
* Because dissonance is acceptable, second-species is even more dominated by stepwise motion.
* If a leap is necessary, leap from strong to weak beat within the bar
* Have 1 or 2 secondary climaxes in the couterpoint as local extrema
* Begin the same way as 1st species. Can either start w/ 2 half notes or 1 half rest (often preferable)
* End with contrary stepwise motion. Penultimate bar can be 2 half notes or 1 whole note.
* Strong beats are consonant and prefer imperfect consonances
* Same motion rules across barline as 1st species
* Downbeat to downbeat follow first-species rules
* Hidden fifths/octaves are fine as the effect is weak / diminished by intervening note in counterpoint
* Mix dissonant and consonant notes on weak beats
* Unison on weak beats is ok when necessary to make good counterpoint
* Should be dissonant passing tones (between consonant downbeats) in stepwise motion
* Consonant passing tones can be used
* A substitution uses a third on downbeats but leaps a fourth on weak beat and then steps down to add variety. Must be consonant.
* Skipped passing tone outlines 4th between downbeats. Weak beat divides into third and step
* Interval subdivision outlines a 5th or 6th broken into 2 thirds or third+fourth. Consonance all around
* Change of register large consonant leap (P5, 6, octave) from strong to weak then step in opposite
* Delay of melodic progression is step between downbeats w/ leap of third in between
* Consonant neighbor tone step on weak then back on next strong

## Strict four-voice composition

### Introduction to thoroughbass

http://openmusictheory.com/thoroughbassFigures.html

* A.k.a basso continuo, figured bass - harmonic shorthand of a musical passage / work
* Has a bass line with chord symbols called figures
* Contains the lowest sounding note at any momemt regardless of the voice
    * Usually a single instrument but not always
* Shows simple intervals above the bass line for all pitch classes in the chord
* Largest number is usually a 7th. Others are reduced mod 7
* Often abbreviated with rules:
    * Assume 5th unless there's a 6
    * Assume 3rd unless 2 or 4


### History of basso continuo (thorough bass)

* A way for a keyboardist to accompany a few voices and replace multiple missing voices
* The lowest note of each beat is taken an played on the keyaboard regardless if this means changing voice in the original composition
* Keyboardist then adds chords for good voice leading
* Basso continuo can help as a harmonic reduction of complex texture

### Roman numerals from figured bass

* 5/3 or 7/5/3: root position - triad 1 3 5
* 6/3 or 6/5/3: first inversion, root is top note (6 in figure) - triad 3 5 1
* 6/4 or 6/4/3 or 4/3: second inversion, root is 4th above bass - triad 5 1 3
* 6/4/2 or 4/2 or 2: third inversion, root is a second above bass- 7th 7 1 3 5



## Musical functions

* Function is the rolow that a musical element plays in the larger unit. It is tied to expectation and the subversion thereof.
* Function has 2 features:
    * Characteristics of musical elements that belong to the function
    * Kinds of elements that tend to surround it in musical succession
* The study of style and function are inextricably linked. The same elements may have different functions in different styles.
* In western music, harmony and form are most commonly associated w/ function
* Study of harmony/form is: a matter interpreting the role that chords, phrases, modules, etc. play in the larger context in which they are found.
    * It goes beyond simple indentification, though that is a necessary step.

### Harmonic functions

http://openmusictheory.com/harmonicFunctions.html

* Describes the role that a chord plays in the creation of a larger harmonic progression
* Principles (root and quality are not considered)
    * Chords are collections of scale degrees
    * Each scale degree has its own tendencies
    * The collective tendencies of a chord's scale degrees in combination is the chord's function
* The same chord can have different functions in different styles
* Common practice
    * Tonic (T)
        * I, III, VI
        * Characteristic scale degrees: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7
    * Subdominant (S) or predominant (P / PD)
        * II, IV
        * Characteristic scale degrees: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
    * Dominant (D)
        * V, VII
        * Characteristic scale degrees: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7

### Classical cadence types

http://openmusictheory.com/cadenceTypes.html

* Authentic cadence: D5-T1 (V7-I)
    * Perfect authentic cadence: V-I
    * Imperfect authentic cadence ends on iii or III
* Half cadence: ends on V
