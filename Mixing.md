# Mixing and mastering

## Bounce to audio and make new project

Underbelly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP1dSPX8doc

1. Disable unnecessary effects

2. Disable unnecessary automation

3. Extract drum rack instruments to individual tracks

4. Export "all individual tracks".
    * Note that groups are bounced as single tracks and 1 big group track.
    * Increase render length to add some dead time at the end
    * Leave normalize on to reset relative volumes

5. Make an empty live set. Drag and drop everything in with Ctrl for new tracks.

6. Color code and organize everything. Sort based on entry time

## Establish relative volumes

Underbelly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmn_ZJ1pdfg

1. Bring all tracks to -Inf

2. Start with most important element and set to something like -12

3. Switch to session view and increase next track volume while only listening until you like the mix

4. Rinse, repeat. Finish 1 group then move to next group.

## Panorama and phasing

Underbelly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DQeE3WUKEI

1. The Ableton pan knob isn't a pan knob. It's a balance knob ya dingus.

2. Right click -> Split stereo pan mode to get pan sliders

3. Check for phasing issues when converting to mono

## Mid/side EQ

Underbelly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlGYmSPy5DE

1. Make foundational elements (e.g. bass, kick) as mono as possible

2. Add utility, right click panner and change to mid/side mode to hear these frequencies

3. Add EQ Eight, set mode to M/S to EQ the middle and sides

4. Low cut the sides for bass

5. To bring out airyness / reverb of tracks, boost those signals on the sides

6. Consider cutting similar frequencies from the middle for space in the middle

## Analyzing tracks using EQ

Underbelly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_KIHqHb_jA

1. Get a reference track and put an EQ 8 on it

2. Click the yellow triange to expand the spectrum graph

3. Turn up a band to understand. Click headphone, hold alt and drag to get a narrow band

4. 40 hz - E is the lower end of what speakers can reproduce

5. Tune bass and kick to different notes so they don't conflict

6. Including higher overtones around 150 hz helps with crappy laptop and phone speakers

7. Tune drum elements to key of the song

## Layering sounds

"Onions have layers, but so do beats"

1. Layers should complement, not compete

2. Make layers distinct using different strategies: change pitch, tambre, etc.

3. Use EQ to cut out frequency ranges emphasized from other layers

## Using reference tracks

Underbelly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3fMK4tHFA0

"Comparing yourself to others can make you feel inadequate, especially in reference to your shitsongs"

1. Select some reference tracks that have some flaws or exhibit extreme behavior you don't like. They will tell you when you've strayed too far from the target.

2. Compare volumes using loudness meter and adjust all tracks to match volumes. That avoids bias because "louder is more good"

3. Use the reference tracks when adjusting components of your track (e.g. bass level, high-end in instruments, etc.)

## Fixing muddiness

Underbelly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISqEnvAq2ao

1. Happens when too many sounds accumulate in the lower-mids

2. Go through components to find muddiness. Can use the EQ approach to find these.

2. Adjusting with an EQ is the obvious approach but can be heavy-handed

3. Instead of EQ, consider a multiband comp to compress some of the muddy bands

4. Set low cutoff to be higher than the low sub. Compress the muddy midrange.

## EQ before or after compression

Underbelly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDnfm7e_vWU

1. Conventional wisdom is EQ before compression. This orientation means that an EQ change can require a corresponding compressor change

2. Switch to use compression first to avoid this problem

3. When there's a fair amount of signal that's not part of the sound, filter that with EQ first so the compressor doesn't need to deal with it.

## Making your own de-esser

Underbelly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y36rFBUYhEc

1. Just filtering with EQ or built-in de-esser applies filter to entire signal

2. Use multiband compressor to target the offending frequencies dynamically instead

## Panning

Underbelly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLdn7WrGGPk

1. The balance knob doesn't mix channels

2. Moving too much to a single channel can be disruptive. Keep foundational items like kick in the middle but move some to the sides

## Stereo width

Underbelly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjRTE41iu7s

"A good mix is like a beautiful woman; strong and wide"

1. Duplicating a track and panning L/R is insufficient

2. To fix, delay one track a bit (~8ms) or detune a bit (~15 ct)

3. Adding a delay effect can then result in a phaser-like effect

## Adding space and depth

Underbelly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2s6WF1B7ok

1. Use panning and reverb / delay sends to add space

2. Trade off parts so not everything is sounding at the same time
